In 2017, I set out to watch lots of new movies and record them in my notes app on
my phone. Surprisingly I was able to keep up with this for the whole year (only
rewatching 5 movies the whole year). I was very inspired to do this by Channel
Awesome's series ["Tamara's Never Seen"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0AQIMR-tpomHjCs4q1K4V0tLWTOYK7sI)
staring the ever so wonderful [Tamara Chambers](https://www.youtube.com/user/tamaralynnchambers).

Last year, all I did was record that I had watched the movies, but in 2018 I am
wanting to watch at least the same amount of movies (ideally more). Then I will
write my thoughts on them here for all to enjoy hoping to reach audiences of both
people who have and have not seen the movies will watch in the coming year.

As a reference, I have posted below the list from my phone of the movies I saw
in 2017. Feel free to ask me about any of them, and what I thought. You will notice,
however, that there are emojis next to each title. These are my take aways from
the film. At first I was using the emojis to express what I felt, but you will find that
it quickly turned to key ideas from the film instead.
