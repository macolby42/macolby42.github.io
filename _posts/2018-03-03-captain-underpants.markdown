And we continue with the airport catch up session by talking about Captain
Underpants. Let's get into it.

<h2> Overview </h2>

If you are anything like me, you are wary of children's animated films, and
films that are adapting previous works (e.g. show, books, games, etc.). So,
given this new knowledge I am sure you can imagine the amount of wariness I had
when I heard about this film that falls into both of those categories. I grew up
with the Captain Underpants books, and it has probably been since 2003 since I
actually read any of them, I still felt some sort of attachment to the series,
and wanted it to succeed.

And you know what... I had a really good time in this film. I found that a lot
of the jokes landed and that everything stayed visual interesting. If you are
unfamiliar with the series this is based on I will not explain it here, because
the movie anticipated this. I think it did a really good job with getting
"newcomers" caught up on all the lore your need to know about Captain
Underpants. But, our two main characters are the best of friends and are
inseparable. They have a really mean principal (because that's a thing), and
he is always out to get them because our dynamic duo are huge pranksters. They
end up hypnotizing the principal and shenanigans ensue. After that, it's
basically the ride of seeing what zany thing happens next. And I guess some good
lessons are learned along the way.

<h2> Lessons </h2>

As opposed to the previous blog on [Whisper of the Heart]({{ "/posts/2018-03-03-whisper-of-the-heart" }})
the lesson here doesn't really seem to be anything about education. The focus of
this movie is really about how we treat others which I think a lesson that kids
can really use on top of that mentioned previously. I think one of my favorite
and more memorable moments in the movie is when it gets a little serious. The
two boys end up taking the principal to his house where they (but really we) get
a look into why the principal is the way he is. Thankfully this is a decent
movie and that plays into the ending and resolution.
