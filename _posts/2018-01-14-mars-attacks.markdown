When I was a little kid, around nine or ten-years-old, I was flipping through the
channels one weekend when I came across the very odd scene of a stampede of cattle
that was on fire. For some reason this intrigued the little kid me so I continued
to watch. I wanted to see where this movie was going with such a scene, but around
the time the movie revealed what the Martians looked like I started to get worried.
To clarify, as a child, I had this odd fear of skulls. I mean, skulls should be scary
to a little kid, right? There was also something about the way the Martians spoke
really freaked me out. For some reason, I kept watching until the Martians shot
the dove, and then the rest of the greeting party.

At that moment I was absolutely terrified. I immediately shut the television off,
and the next thing I remember is having an immense amount of trouble going to bed
that night. Somehow my young mind managed to calm down my fear of killer aliens,
and get some rest. From that moment on I had a fear of Tim Burton's aliens, and
avoided them ever since. Until now...

I'm twenty-two years-old now, and if you've looked at [my list]({{ "/about/" }}) from 2017, you know
that I have seen much scarier movies than this one. So, I thought this would be a
very fitting film to start off this project.

<h2> Overview </h2>

Mars Attacks! is a film directed and produced by Tim Burton with a whole
host of big name stars about Martians, well, attacking. Attacking what? I guess
you could say Earth, but really this film takes that to mean the United States.
And this could easily be part of the running joke since this is supposed to be an
homage/parody of 1950's alien invasion films which also played it as a "global
crisis", but that just really meant it happening to America. But that is basically
what this film is: an alien invasion film. Need you more?

<h2> Plot </h2>

Mars Attacks takes way too much time trying to build up these characters that
I ended up just not caring about. The film is really two halves (not really split
in half); the first half being boring character "development" and the second half
is the non-stop invasion. You would hope that the invasion would be fun, and it
is at points, but I didn't really care much for the set of characters we were given.
And usually I love tales that start out with characters that look like they have
seemingly unconnected lives, but by the end they connect. I find that really fun trying
to seem how it all comes together. In that boring first half you get introduced to
to many different people in such an unorganized way that it did not give flow to the
film's beginning, which I feel hurt how we were supposed to connect to these characters.

<h2> Characters </h2>

For me to feel that a movie has "well written characters", I should be able to think
back to the experience and feel as if I had peered into this world that were as
believable as our own. I should feel as if I had met them, and know them. I did not
get this feeling from the characters in this, but that might have been the intention
by Burton. In a way it is fitting as an homage to the older films who probably had
even less development than the characters in this film. More on characters in the
Spoiler Corner.

<h2> Visuals </h2>

Something, else I found disappointing was the effects. Not the practical effects
they made heavy use of, but there is also a heavy, if not infamous, use of CGI in
this film. I found this to be very sad considering that this is a movie
that is supposed to be an homage to 1950's alien invasion films. I thought that
it would have been more of a sweet love letter to these older films if they had
used actual costumed actors to play the Martians, instead of the dumpy postcard
they sent the films with the cheesy CGI. The sad part is that they did make use
of actual alien corpses in certain scenes.

As far as the cinematography is concerned with Mars Attacks it is fine. I don't
recall there being any breathtaking shots or interesting angles. All of the shots
seemed to be very straight forward. Nothing really made me think to myself, "Wow,
I see what you did there." But that can also be followed by saying there weren't
really any annoying or ugly shots either (if you disregard any shots containing the
Martians themselves...).

<h2> Spoiler Corner </h2>

I will say that I felt like the better love story in this film was just ignored.
There is this weird arc with Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker's characters
where I guess they are supposed to be in love and they share a kiss (but I could
have cared less). There is also this love story between Jim Brown and Pam Grier's
character who are, for some reason, divorced but seem to still be in love. I found
Jim Brown to probably be the character I cared the most about, and found his relationship
to be the most believable. Sadly the movie doesn't give the audience the same moment
that the other two got.

<h2> Closing Remarks </h2>

You might be wondering if I am still scared of Tim Burton's Martians, and I have to
say that I am not. It is funny what can scare us as kids that we grow out of. I used
to be scared of skulls, but now I listen to a good chuck of Death Metal which has
album covers riddled with skulls being the least of grotesque things that can be
seen. Would I say that this was a bad film? Yeah, I guess so. I felt pretty bored
and didn't feel like I came away from it with much to offer except having conquered
my childhood fear once and for all.
