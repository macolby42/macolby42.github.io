Third blog in a row. Still in the airport. Let's do this!

<h2> Overview </h2>

Battle Royale is something of a film. First of all the acting is... crazy. Okay,
not everyone is crazy, some people are believable and really good. It is really
interesting to see this type of film, especially amid all of the games that are
out now that follow this type of formula. And I will say, that I did see this
soon after the Parkland Shooting in Florida so it was, I think, a bit more
unsettling than usual to watch kids shooting other kids.

If you don't know what a Battle Royale is, basically it is a group of people
placed in a confined area with random weapons and then set loose on each other
to see who the last person alive is. It becomes a very intense formula. I kind
of feel like I have said about as much as I can on it. It's an interesting ride,
and idea, but that's about it. I wouldn't try to press it on people, especially
in times like these with how unsafe kids can be here in America. I will,
however, reveal what my favorite scene was.

<h2> Spoiler Corner </h2>

One of our main characters wakes up after an ordeal and wakes up in a lighthouse
with a girl looking over him. Earlier in the film he had killed another kid by
accident and there is a girl also in the lighthouse that has it out for him.
They are making food and the revenge girl offers to make a plate for the boy so
that she can put poison in it (cyanide, I believe, if you are curious). Another
girl barges in and takes the poisoned plate and begins to consume it. Of course,
this is only known to us and the poisoner, so we are just <i>waiting</i> for
when they all find out. She ends up spewing her guts like out of Hateful Eight.
The girls turn on each other and the dramatic irony continues.

I will say that the scene did make me laugh, because I am a sucker of that
dramatic irony.
